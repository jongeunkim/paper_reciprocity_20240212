# A Reciprocity Between Tree Ensemble Optimization and Multilinear Optimization

The software and data in this repository are a snapshot of the software and data that were used in the research reported on in the paper [A Reciprocity Between Tree Ensemble Optimization and Multilinear Optimization](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HTML/2022/03/8828.html) by Jongeun Kim, Jean-Philippe P. Richard, Monit Tawarmalani.

Directory `sec_5_1/` and `sec_5_2/` contains the source codes used to conduct the computational experiments described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 in the paper, respectively. `READMD.md` in each directory guides how to run mixed-integer programming (MIP) instances. Both use Gurobi as a MIP solver.
